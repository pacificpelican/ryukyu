**[Ryukyu](http://danmckeown.info/code/ryukyu) front-end framework** by [Dan McKeown](http://danmckeown.info).

Ryukyu is designed to work as a simple HTML 5 starter kit for web site projects: it includes a style sheet, [ryukyu.css](css/ryukyu.css), that can be included on many web sites.  Its CSS [conforms](ryukyu-docs/BootstrapAPIcomponents.html) to [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) 3 for some classes like btn-default, text-success, jumbotron and many of the grid selectors.  Ryukyu also includes the [ryukyu.js](js/ryukyu.js) JavaScript library and the [joeypc](http://joeypc.com) JavaScript/[jQuery](http://jquery.com) framework.  Also included are web starter pages: the [backwards-compatible HTML page](HTMLstarter.html) and the [HTML 5 page](HTML5starter.html).

For an idea about Ryukyu can do, check [this screencast on the grid systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnZqFKVtAa8) and [this one on linked list objects created with class declarations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JA_DhelMeJs).

SASS: Ryukyu CSS has been generated from [SCSS source](sass/ryukyu.scss) from version 0.2.5.

Ryukyu provides much of the CSS for the [Fremont Cut theme (aka Theme 12)](https://github.com/pacificpelican/theme12).

Ryukyu is released under the [MIT license](LICENSE).
